# NeuralMI
Example of how to use neural networks as a black box estimator of mutual information for digital communication systems

Showing NN-based achievable information rate estimation for AWGN channel for a 16QAM signal and compare against covnentional 2D Guassian estimate of the achievable information rate.

4D estimates will be added soon.
