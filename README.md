# NeuralMI
Example of how to use neural networks as a black box estimator of mutual information for digital communication systems

Showing NN-based achievable information rate (AIR) estimation for an AWGN channel and a toy-channel with heavy phase noise. Currently only supporting 16QAM signals but it is trivial to change to any QAM format. We compare the NN-based AIR against covnentional 2D Guassian estimate of the achievable information rate.

4D estimates will be added soon.
